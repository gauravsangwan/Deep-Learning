This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model for predicting Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types using a web application built using Python Dash.

To deploy the project on your local system, please follow the following steps:

Download the saved model from the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-1Re62GOlKS5yvqG8ibziWm9i6A4Mr_k/view?usp=sharing

Install Python Dash. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install dash

Run the main.py file with the saved model in the same directory. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

python main.py

Once the application is running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

Follow the instructions on the web page to input a text sample and obtain a prediction of the corresponding MBTI personality type.
